## Credits
The format of this repo is taken from [pretzelhammer's rust-blog](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog).
I found myself choosing to publish in this way for many of the same reasons pretzelhammer cites in their post 
[Why Blog?](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/why-blog.md).
Their blog's format felt easily accessible and more than sufficient for my needs, so I decided not to reinvent the wheel.

In keeping with true copy-pasta fashion, I've decided to start mine the same way, 
in my own [Why blog?](./posts/why-blog.md) post.
