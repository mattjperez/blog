# Why Blog?

# Why Write Blogs
- I learn a lot from blogs like these; I'd like to do my part in making useful information (technical or otherwise) more searchable and available to others.
- Helps me solidify what I've learned and forms a natural template for future presentations on the topics.
- To practice and experiment with writing for different audiences.
- Gain confidence in exposing my thoughts and logic to the review and criticisms of others.

# Why a GitHub Repo
I don't care much for frontend development and too lazy to learn another language just to use a static site generator with more reader-friendly themes.
